Lesson Plan for Building an R Package

Objective: To learn how to build a package in R with custom functions and data set.

Prerequisites:

Basic R programming knowledge
Familiarity with R functions and documentation
Duration: 60-90 minutes

Materials:

RStudio
Project folder
Lesson Steps:

Introduction to R Packages

Discuss the use of R Packages
Explain how packages make R code reusable
Outline the components of an R package
Set Up the Project Folder

Create a new R project in RStudio
Use devtools::create("package_name") function to create a new package
Discuss the structure of the directories and files in a package
Navigate the project folder, showing the purpose of each folder
Write Custom Scripts

Create two custom functions in separate files and save them in the package’s “./R” folder
Use user-defined functions to extract important information from a data frame
Add in-line documentation to the functions
Data Set

Add a data set file in the package’s “./data” folder
Create an R script to load data set into the environment
Assign in-line documentation to the data set
Build the Package

Use the devtools::document() function to generate documentation files
Use the devtools::build() function to build the package
Discuss the generated source code and output files
Share the package with peers using the install.packages() function.
Summary

Recap the package development process
Explain the benefits of using R packages
Suggest more advanced topics for further exploration.
Assessment:

Have students follow the lesson plan to build a package
Review their code files to ensure the proper creation of functions and documentation
Observe the students' ability to execute functions directly from the package
Assess their use of exported functions correctly
Extensions:

Create a vignette to explain the use cases of the package
Add unit tests for your functions using testthat package
Add a license to the package using a tool like rencentr is a good idea.
